# Anti-Spoofing-System
A security system designed to detect and prevent face spoofing attacks using liveness detection techniques, ensuring only real users can authenticate. It distinguishes between real and fake faces (like photos, videos, or masks) using motion, texture, or depth-based cues. Useful for enhancing biometric authentication systems in applications like secure login, attendance, and access control.
